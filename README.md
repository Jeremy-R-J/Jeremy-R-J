- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jeremy-R-J
- 👀 After completeing Bootcamp Im now self teaching more about React.js.  Going through through the full stack program at Coding Dojo was eye opening to a career I should have started a long time ago.  I have experience with Python, Java, and React.js with the ability to pick up other languages as needed.   
- 🌱 I ended the Dojo with the highest marks you could obtain in the MERN stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, totally open.  I have a lot of Service Industry and Management experience and am looking forward to using the talents while Im learning with other indviduals to complete projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email me at "johnsjrmy@gmail.com"!
