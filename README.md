- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jeremy-R-J
- 👀 I’m interested in learining my way around programming.  I'm so close to finishing my Coding Dojo Bootcamp, where I have learned 3 seperate full stack programing languages.
Pyhton(Django),Java,MERN, are the first three I learned Im acctually in the process of continuing this education when I finish while I look for a web development job.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN just getting comfortable with hooks and using them in the correct ways to dynamically reneder my applications correctly.

other talented indviduals to complete projects.
